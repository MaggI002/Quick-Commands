All configs are located in the same directory as this python file
:editors
Feel free to edit any files found here that end with .conf, including the editors.conf file.

The config files have one line as a menu entry and the line right after it as the command. Commands can not start with a : (colon).
:editors
Comments can be added before the menu entry or after the command by putting a # (hash symbol) at the begining of the line.
:editors
To add a space to fill in into the command (for example for an URL), add a description of what to fill in into the command surrounded by backticks like this: `This is a description of what to enter here`
:editors
To add a hyperlink to a menu entry, add a description or name of the link comma link surrounded by dollar signs like this: [dollar sign]description or name,link[dollar sign]
:editors
If your terminal application does not support hyperlinks, you can enable alternative hyperlinks in the settings, which also include the link that you entered. Here is a test hyperlink: $Click me!,https://bit.ly/3uTw3UC$
